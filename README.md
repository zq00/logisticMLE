# logisticMLE

This repository contains raw code that reproduces results in the paper "The Asymptotic Distribution of the MLE in High-dimensional Logistic Models: Arbitrary Covariance".

If you are interested to experiment on your own, you can install the r package (see package description and examples [here](https://zq00.github.io/glmhd/index.html)) which contains functions to implement methods in the article

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zq00/glmhd")
```
